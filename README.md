## Overview
This project is a real-time anomaly detection tool for continuous data streams. It detects anomalies in metrics like financial transactions or system monitoring data. The tool simulates a data stream, detects unusual data points, and displays them visually in real time.

## Features
- **Real-time anomaly detection**: Flags anomalies as data is streamed.
- **Simulated data stream**: Mimics realistic data patterns.
- **Threshold-based detection**: Customize sensitivity for anomaly detection.
- **Visualization**: Live plot showing data stream with anomalies highlighted.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nazha55/Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection.git
cd Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
To run the project, execute the main.py script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Youâ€™ll see a real-time plot displaying the data stream with anomalies highlighted in red.

Customization
Threshold: Adjust the sensitivity of anomaly detection by modifying the threshold parameter in operation.py.
Data Patterns: Customize the stream's behavior by modifying the simulate_data_stream function.
Conclusion
This project offers a simple yet powerful tool for detecting anomalies in continuous data streams. Adjust parameters to fit your use case, whether for financial monitoring or system anomaly detection.
